# Contributing

This repository is **not accepting public contributions** at this time.

Rationale:
- The public repository is a restricted specification surface.
- Operational implementation details are intentionally withheld.
- Changes must preserve doctrinal consistency and licensing constraints.

You may open issues for:
- typo corrections,
- broken links,
- schema inconsistencies,
- ambiguous wording in the restricted specification.

Do not submit:
- implementation code,
- operational checklists,
- calibration proposals,
- sector-specific thresholds,
- or executable examples.
