# FAQ

## Is this an open-source project?

No. This repository is proprietary and restricted. It is a specification surface, not an implementation.

## Can I implement IIP‑Scoring™ from this repository?

No. Implementation details, operational heuristics, calibration, and thresholds are intentionally omitted.

## Why publish schemas if the implementation is private?

Schemas define **interfaces** for interchange and audit record structure. They do not encode algorithms or calibration. Publishing interfaces supports interoperability without disclosing operational recipes.

## Do you provide audits?

Yes, under licensed engagements.

## Does a high score imply compliance?

No. IIP‑Scoring™ is an evidence layer. Compliance requires a broader program and legal interpretation.

## Where is the canonical doctrine?

The canonical identity and doctrine anchors are published on the canonical site listed in `canonical-urls.md`.
