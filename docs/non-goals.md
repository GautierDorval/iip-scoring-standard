# Non-goals

This repository is intentionally restricted and non-operational.

It does not aim to:
- teach implementation,
- provide executable tooling,
- publish scoring recipes,
- publish calibrated thresholds or sector profiles,
- publish client-ready report templates,
- provide complete QBank sets,
- provide datasets or benchmarks.

If you need deployment or audit execution, that is available only through licensed engagements.
