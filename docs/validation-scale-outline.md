# Validation scale (outline)

This document outlines discrete validation grades and non-compensable gates at a conceptual level.

No operational thresholds are published in this repository.

## Grades (conceptual)

- **L0 — Non-qualifiable**  
  Evidence chain is incomplete; results are not opposable.

- **L1 — High-risk**  
  Material distortion or unbounded inference is present in critical segments, or evidence traceability is insufficient.

- **L2 — Governable**  
  The run is traceable; findings can be used to improve the corpus and reduce ambiguity, but audit-grade assurance is not claimed.

- **L3 — Conformant (audit-ready)**  
  Strong evidence chain, controlled QBank governance, and documented conditions enable audit-style interpretation and remediation.

- **L4 — Audit-grade**  
  Highest maturity. Requires strengthened reproducibility, robust annotation QA, and temporal stability practices where applicable.

## Gates (conceptual)

Gates are non-compensable. A high composite score cannot compensate for failing a critical gate.

Typical gate classes (non-exhaustive):
- Evidence chain completeness
- Critical segment constraints
- Annotation QA and reviewer agreement
- Snapshot/QBank version integrity
- Temporal continuity rules (where applicable)

Operational thresholds and decision rules are intentionally withheld.
