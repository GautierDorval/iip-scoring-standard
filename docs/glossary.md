# Glossary (restricted)

This glossary is normative for this repository.

## Interpretive integrity

The property that a system’s outputs remain bounded by declared scope and evidence, avoiding ungrounded projection and preserving unknowns.

## Corpus snapshot

A frozen, versioned representation of the sources recognized as ground truth for an audit run. The snapshot is the only admissible evidence base within the protocol family.

## Canonical surface

A declared, authoritative reference surface intended to reduce ambiguity and constrain reconstruction (e.g., a canonical definition page, a doctrine index, a machine-first artifact).

## QBank (Question Bank)

A versioned set of prompts/questions, typed and segmented, used to probe interpretation boundaries and integrity under controlled conditions.

## Segment (S)

A governance-relevant categorization of questions (e.g., identity, scope, pricing, certifications, legal claims). Segments may include a critical subset.

## Critical segment (S_crit)

A segment where errors or ungrounded inference may yield disproportionate harm (e.g., legal, pricing, guarantees, compliance, individual decision contexts).

## Evidence chain

The set of artifacts that makes a run reproducible and reviewable (snapshot manifest, QBank version, run parameters, raw outputs, annotation logs, hashes).

## Opposability

A property of an audit where results can be challenged and re-evaluated against the same frozen evidence base, with traceable provenance and integrity signals.

## Gate / Grade

A gate is a non-compensable validation condition. A grade is a discrete level indicating audit maturity and evidentiary strength.

## NSS-temporal (concept)

A stability signal across time points (t0/t1) under documented snapshots and controlled QCore continuity. This repository describes the concept but does not publish operational thresholds.
