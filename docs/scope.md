# Scope and boundaries

## Purpose

IIP‑Scoring™ is designed to evaluate **interpretive integrity** under uncertainty by comparing model outputs to a **declared corpus snapshot** and its canonical surfaces.

The protocol is designed for:
- interpretive audits,
- entity reconstruction integrity,
- anti-inference boundary testing,
- attribution integrity checks,
- documentation governance and controlled evolution.

## Applies to

- Machine interpretation of content and entities
- Probabilistic reasoning outputs (including generative models)
- Summarization, synthesis, and answer generation
- Agentic environments (when explicitly instrumented and logged)

## Does not apply to

- Marketing performance optimization
- Visibility ranking promises or guarantees
- Legal advice or regulatory compliance advice
- Political or social-science “interpretive governance” (academic field)
- Model safety layers, moderation systems, or policy enforcement replacements

## Canonical constraint

Within IIP‑Scoring™, a claim can only be considered **grounded** if it can be anchored to the declared corpus snapshot and its canonical surfaces.

Anything not anchored to the snapshot is treated as ungrounded within the scope of the protocol.
