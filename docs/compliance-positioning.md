# Compliance positioning (non-legal)

This repository positions IIP‑Scoring™ as an **evidence layer** for interpretive integrity audits.

It does not provide compliance guarantees and does not replace:
- legal counsel,
- regulatory compliance programs,
- privacy impact assessments,
- or model safety/moderation systems.

## Alignment concept

IIP‑Scoring™ can support governance programs by producing:
- traceable records (run logs, snapshot manifests, versioning),
- auditable evidence chains,
- structured outputs and validation gates,
- documentation of interpretive risks and remediation.

## Common frameworks (informative)

This material is intended to be compatible with governance approaches such as:
- risk management life-cycles,
- audit record-keeping expectations,
- management-system standards for AI governance.

Specific regulatory mappings, thresholds, and sector profiles are private and may be provided under contract.
