# Trademarks and naming notice (non-legal)

This repository uses the following marks as product and metric identifiers:

- IIP‑Scoring™
- MVS™
- IR™
- IDI™
- NSS™
- IIS™

Use of the ™ symbol indicates a **claim of trademark usage**, not a statement that a mark is registered in any jurisdiction.

## Allowed references

You may refer to these marks when:
- citing this repository,
- discussing the protocol conceptually,
- describing interfaces (schemas) and artifacts.

## Prohibited representations

You must not:
- imply endorsement, certification, or authorization by Gautier Dorval,
- market a competing scoring service as “IIP‑Scoring™ compliant” without a license,
- use the marks in a way that could cause confusion about source, ownership, or official status.

## Practical guidance

If you need to describe the metrics without using the marks, use descriptive names (e.g., “inference rate” instead of IR™).
